# Introduction to Protein Blocks

Protein Blocks (PBs) are structural prototypes defined by [de Brevern](http://www.dsimb.inserm.fr/~debrevern/index.php) *et al* in 2000 [1]. Their main interest is to modelize the 3-dimensional local structure of the protein backbone into a 1-dimension sequence. In principle, any conformation of any amino acid could be represented by one of the sixteen available Protein Blocks. PBs are labeled from a to p (see Figure 1): the PBs *m* and *d* can be roughly described as prototypes for alpha-helix and central beta-strand, respectively. PBs *a* to *c* primarily represent beta-strand N-caps and PBs *e* and *f*, beta-strand C-caps; PBs *a* to *j* are specific to coils, PBs *k* and *l* to alpha-helix N-caps, and PBs *n* to *p* to alpha-helix C-caps.

For instance, the 3D structure of the barstar protein in Figure 2 is represented in term of Protein Blocks:

The conformations of the 89 residues are translated into a sequence of 89 protein blocks. Note that "Z" is a default name given to amino acid for which a protein block cannot be assigned. Indeed, the assignation procedure for a given residue requires the conformation of the two residues placed before and the two residues placed after the residue under consideration. Therefore, a protein block cannot be assigned to the two first (N-termini) and two last (C-termini) residues of a polypeptide chain.
