3 demonstration scripts are available:

* `run_demo1_assignation.sh` demonstrates the how to use `PBassign` to assign
  Protein Block sequences to protein structures;
* `run_demo2_statistics.sh` demonstrates how to analyse protein dynamics using
  PBxplore;
* finally, `run_demo2_clusters.sh`demonstrates how to use `PBclust` to cluster
  Protein Block sequences.

In addition to the scripts, PBxplore bundles input files to test and get
accustom with the software and the python library. Call the `PBdata` program to
display where these files are stored. With the `--list` and `--list-abs`
