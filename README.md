**PBxplore** is a suite of tools dedicated to Protein Block analysis. Protein Blocks are structural prototypes defined by [de Brevern](http://www.dsimb.inserm.fr/~debrevern/index.php) *et al* [1]. The 3-dimensional local structure of a protein backbone can be modelized as an 1-dimensional sequence of PBs. In principle, any conformation of any amino acid could be represented by one of the sixteen available Protein Blocks (see Figure 1).

# Requirements

PBxplore requires: 

* Python 2.7, 
* the [NumPy](http://numpy.scipy.org/ "NumPy") Python library, 
* the R software.

Optionnaly, PBxplore can use:

* the [MDAnalysis](https://code.google.com/p/mdanalysis/) Python library to read MD trajectories generated by Gromacs (.xtc files),
* [WebLogo](http://weblogo.berkeley.edu/) to create logo from PB sequences.
